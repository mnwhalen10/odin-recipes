<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While "crudo" is the shorthand, most often the preparation's name has a bit more detail given its many possible forms. There's crudo di tonno (tuna crudo), crudo di pesce spada (swordfish crudo), and crudo di cozze (mussel crudo), for example. When the fish is very thinly sliced, it will also sometimes go by the name "carpaccio." Here, we have crudo di capesante, or scallop crudo. It is a dish so simple, dressed with little more than olive oil and salt, that there is almost nothing to say about how to make it beyond one very important thing. Can you guess what that thing is? That's right! Quality of ingredients!</p>
<p>Just as you have flexibility in the type of seafood you select for crudo, you also have flexibility on how it's garnished and seasoned. There's no right answer, whether for this scallop crudo or any other. Generally, it's smart to keep it simple and restrained, so that whatever seafood you're using can shine through. For these scallops, I've opted for a light drizzle of good olive oil, a delicate squeeze of fresh lemon juice, some flaky sea salt, and a judicious sprinkle of chile flakes and lemon zest for just a pop of flavor. Some people like to toss some capers on the plate, some add herbs or other spices like black pepper, or reach of a different citrus juice, like orange. Feel free to play, there are no fixed rules.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Most scallops are treated with a chemical to help them retain moisture before being sold. When buying scallops, look for never-frozen "dry" scallops that are sold as-is from the ocean. If they are un-labeled, look for the telltale milky white liquid: if the scallops have any liquid pooled around them, they are wet scallops and you should not use them. If dry scallops are unavailable, any sashimi-grade fish can be used in their place.</p>

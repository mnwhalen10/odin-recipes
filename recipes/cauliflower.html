<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It wasn’t until adulthood that I learned the joys of nutty, rich, roasted cauliflower. Roasting it at a high temperature creates a crisp exterior with a tender—but not mushy—interior. The high heat also ensures that those unpleasant sulfurous compounds don't form. Today, cauliflower is a staple in my dinner rotation: It’s easy to make, pairs well with just about everything, and can be dressed up with a favorite seasoning blend, fresh herbs, or a simple sauce I already have on hand. </p>
<p>On a busy weeknight, my favorite way to roast cauliflower is in my air fryer. I just press a few buttons, and the air fryer is ready to go. There’s a reason why the appliance is such a popular powerhouse: It’s basically a tiny convection oven that circulates air efficiently to promote browning on food, which is why it’s so great at quickly and perfectly roasting vegetables.</p>
<p>Though cooking cauliflower in the air fryer isn’t complicated, there are a few tips and tricks to help you make flavorful cauliflower that’s both crisp and tender. We asked seasoned recipe developer Julia Levy to methodically test air-fryer–roasted cauliflower by cooking batch after batch until she'd perfected the process. Here’s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>One large head cauliflower (about 1 3/4 pounds; 793g), tough outer leaves and core removed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) neutral oil such as canola or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) water</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt; if using table salt use half as much by volume</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat a 6-quart air fryer to 400°F (205ºC) for 5 minutes. Cut cauliflower into 8 wedges, then cut into 2-inch florets (should be about 4 cups total). In a large bowl, toss cauliflower with oil, water salt and pepper until well coated; use your hands to make sure all nooks and crannies are coated with oil and seasonings. </li>

    <li>Arrange half (about 2 cups) of the florets into the preheated air fryer basket; cook, shaking basket twice during cooking, until tender and well browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover to keep warm; and repeat cooking with the remaining cauliflower. Combine cauliflower and serve.</li>

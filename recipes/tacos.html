<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <!-- step 1 -->
    <li>Bring 2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add guajillo and pasilla chiles. 
        Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chiles soften, about 10 minutes; transfer to plate. 
        Remove and discard stem and seeds. Meanwhile, coarsely chop one onion half; reserve remaining half. 
        Strain pineapples; reserve juice and fruit separately.</li>
    <!-- step 2 -->
    <li>Transfer guajillo, pasilla and chipotle chiles, chopped onion half, reserved pineapple juice, vinegar, 
            garlic and cumin to bowl of food processor. Puree until smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer chile mixture to 
            saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring chile mixture to a boil; cook until paste loses raw onion taste, about 
            2 minutes. Season with Adobo; cool. In large container with lid, or in large ziptop bag, combine pork cubes, 
            cooled chile marinade and reserved pineapple chunks; transfer to refrigerator. Marinate at least 2 hours, 
            or up to 24 hours.</li>
    <!-- step 3 -->
    <li>Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Strain pork and pineapples, discarding marinade. 
        Add pork and pineapples to skillet. Cook in batches until dark golden brown on all sides and cooked through, 
        about 15 minutes; transfer to large serving plate.</li>
    <!-- step 4 -->
     <li>Meanwhile, finely slice remaining onion half. Transfer sliced onion to bowl with cilantro. 
        Serve pork and pineapple mixture in warm tortillas. Garnish pork tacos with cilantro, onions 
        and limes.</li>
